#1. Tiger and Dried Persimmon Once upon a time, there lived a huge tiger and famous for its scary roars in the deep mountains. People called him the "Seonggun Lake." Proud of being the owner of the mountain, he would one day go down to the village and raid the hen house or the barn. People trembled just by the sight of his footsteps, but the tiger himself did not know much about human things. On a cold winter night, the mountain army came down the snowy mountain path in search of something to eat. When the wind blew bitterly and snow flew, the tiger followed the smell to the village mouth.Smoke rose from the chimney, and a delicious smell tickled the tip of my nose somewhere. It was a house where a pregnant woman cooked chestnuts to soothe her child. The tiger could overhear people's stories under the chimney. "Dude, don't cry. If you don't stay still, a scary tiger will come in the mountains." The child burst into tears even harder. 'Tiger, isn't it me? But why isn't he so scared?' The tiger was curious. Everyone ran away when they heard the tiger, but the child was crying loudly.Then the mother hugged the child again and said.  "Still, don't cry. The tiger will come and take you away." But the boy didn't stop saying that. Rather, he stomped his feet, saying, "No! I don't want to!" The tiger was embarrassed by the sight. "That's strange. Isn't that human being afraid of a cheap naval corvette? What on earth are they afraid of?" It was then. The exhausted mother took out a bundle of dried persimmons from the pot and said, "Don't cry. I'll give you dried persimmons. Now, it's a delicious dried persimmon." The baby stopped crying and opened its mouth.When a sweet smell spread through the room, the tiger's ears perked up. 'What kind of person is a dog that used to cry like that? Is it scarier than a tiger?' The tiger became increasingly scared when he thought. He felt that there might be something scarier and stronger hidden in the human world than him. Then the window suddenly opened, and a shadow swept into the room in the moonlight. It was a cattle thief in a neighboring village. He was hiding in a snowstorm and looking for a house to steal.When I happened to not see the shadow of the tiger, I came down to the wall and whispered, "You are lucky today. I heard there are a lot of dried persimmons in this house." The tiger was surprised to hear that. 'What? The dried persimmons are in this house? Plus, that human came to steal them? Oh, my God, they must be very scary. Or, are they so delicious that humans risk their lives to steal them?' He began to tremble without thinking any more. 'What if they eat me like this?' At that moment, the thief touched something in the dark yard.It had rough, thick fur and the shape of a large lump. "Huh, what big cow?" But it was not a cow, but a tiger. The thief whispered carefully in the dark, unaware that it was a tiger. "OK, let's go steal the dried persimmon. Let's go for a ride, kid." He climbed on the tiger's back. The tiger trembled at a loss and misunderstood, "The dried persimmon has come!" "You have to run away if you want to live!" The tiger started running to the mountain, kicking his hind legs with all his might, engulfed in ominous thoughts.The blizzard shriveled, and the villagers heard the roar and all lit up. The thief instantly lost his mind. "Oh, what is this! It's not a horse, it's a tiger!" He ran into the mountain, clinging tightly to it without even yelling. After running for a long time, the tiger eventually stopped near a big rock. His whole body was soaked in sweat, and his eyes were tangled in his fur. The thief on his back couldn't hold it anymore and fell straight and fainted. The tiger mumbled, looking at him with frightened eyes."Is this a dried persimmon? Has it turned into a human form?" When the fainted thief stopped, he thought, "A scary person can give fear even if he doesn't move." Since then, the tiger has hardly lived near the village. It trembled every night in case of a dried persimmon, warning other tigers, too. "No matter how hungry you are, don't go near the village. There lives a monster called a dried persimmon." So other animals in the mountain believed it, and they didn't go down to the village without knowing what a dried persimmon was.But the villagers couldn't help but laugh for a while after it happened. They talked about dried persimmons every night and told the children, "I mean, even the most scary tiger can't move in front of it." Since then, people around the world have said this when making fun of him.  "What a tiger is afraid of is a dried persimmon, not a gun or a spear." Whenever it snows every winter, it is said to hear a growl through the mountain breeze. It could have been the sound of a mountain tiger still afraid of dried persimmons. #2.Once upon a time, there lived a tiger in the deep and deep mountains. He was strong and bulky, and all the mountain animals were shivering. But as time went by and he got older, he suddenly felt empty. "It's lonely for even the king of this mountain to live alone. I should get married, too." That's how the tiger decided. But who among the mountain animals would dare to be the tiger's bride? The fox shook its head, saying it was clumsy, and the roe deer ran away in fear. Until then, tigers didn't know that finding a mate is harder than hunting.So the tiger decided to go down to the village over the mountain. People always prepare delicious, smelly food and live by warming up their houses. He thought there might be a kind-hearted new bride among them. That evening, the moon rose and there was no wind in the village. The tiger carefully hid itself through the rice paddies and smelled people living there. Then, I heard laughter from a house. "There is a wedding at that house today. The drums are ringing, and the lanterns are bright.""The tiger murmured as he listened to it."Yeah, this is how you get married. I'm going to get married like that." Thinking so, the tiger sneaked off to his wedding home after people fell asleep after the feast. The red silk jeogori, which the bride was wearing, was drying it with its sparkle in the sun. When the tiger saw it, his heart fluttered and excited. "This is what the bride's dress looks like. I'm getting married in this one." He picked up the silk suit slightly with his big front paws, but he tore it apart because he couldn't control his strength. The tiger was embarrassed, but he wasn't disappointed. It was a beast's wedding blessing! It should be torn apart to be mine."Then he wrapped the torn silk around him and went back to the mountain. Then he called all the mountain animals together. "Hey, tomorrow is my wedding day! Let's have a party!" the animals were surprised. The wild boar frowned and the elk's eyes were round. "Did you save any bride, tiger?" "Of course! My bride is a person." The animals were even more surprised and couldn't keep her mouth shut. The next day, the mountain was busy from dawn. A squirrel collected pine nuts, a magpie bit the flower, and a rabbit split firewood and started a fire. That's how the feast took place in the mountains.A woodpecker tapped on the tree instead of the drum, and the night owl sang clearly instead of the song. Meanwhile, the tiger's mouth was open to its ears. But the problem was the bride. She couldn't show up no matter how long she waited. "What happened? The bride must have been scared." The tiger decided to go pick up the bride herself. He came back down to the village wearing his ' robes' that he had hidden in a rock cave. Then, in the lower part of the mountain, the feast leftover was being served outside. Chicken, rice, and rice cakes were cooling off with an odor when a young woman sat next to her.The tiger said in an exuberant voice, "Finally found my bride." Before she could scream in surprise, the tiger lifted her up and took her to the mountain. The mountain animals cheered, "The bride is here!" but she whispered in a trembling voice. "Tiger, you need a altar to celebrate your wedding." "What is a wedding?" "The groom gives the bride a present before the wedding." The tiger nodded. "Then I will give you the biggest mountain treasure!" He took out the golden deer antlers, honeybee hives, and wild ginseng roots.But Annak's head was looking for a quick plan."That's wonderful. But I must also say hello to my mother before the wedding, Mr. Groom." "That's plausible. Where are you?" "I'm down town. I have to go say hello, so please wait a moment," said the tiger, nodding his head. "If it's the bride's mother, she's my mother-in-law. Go quickly." My wife bowed down and then hurried down the mountain to never come back. When the bride didn't come back after all this time, the tiger became uneasy. The magpie came and whispered."The bride, she'll never come again." The tiger roared when it heard her say, "What are you talking about! I can't believe the bride isn't coming when I'm getting married!" That night, the tiger climbed to the top of the mountain and cried loudly toward the moon. The wind was pounding, and the trees shook. Since then, the villagers have heard the nightly cry and said, "Do you hear that? Today is the day for a tiger to get married again?" And I told the boy, "He's getting married after being caught by a tiger who played late at night." So, even after all these years, people didn't forget the day for the tiger to get married.When the forest echoed loudly on the bright night of the moon, someone would laugh as they were about to get married.#3. Tiger's Boeun Once upon a time, there lived a poor but kind-hearted woodcutter in a deep mountain village. He would wake up at dawn to go up to the mountains to do trees and distribute rice to mountain animals little by little. He was the kind of person who threw millet to birds in the winter and poured water into dried up pools in the summer. On a sunny spring day, the woodcutter went deeper than usual into the mountains. I was about to cut down a good tree and fall into the village when I suddenly heard a cry.At first, I thought it was a bird's cry, but it grew louder and more like a groan of a beast. He followed the sound, and a big tiger was writhing in a trap. His feet were tightly wrapped around a metal cord, and blood was running down them. The tiger's eyes widened and growled, but the woodcutter felt sorry for it. "Hey, you shouldn't hurt anyone, but you've hurt yourself this much." He took a small knife out of his pocket and freed the trap. The tiger was initially alert, but when the cord came off at the woodcutter's fingertips, he exhaled as if in relief.Then he looked at him for a moment, then disappeared into the mountains. The woodcutter thought, 'Let's never go near this beast again,' but then something strange began to happen. When the woodcutter went to the mountain, someone would always pull the trees back in advance, or the mountain animals would make way for him. Sometimes it rained heavily, but not a drop of rain fell where he stood. "That's strange. The mountains seem to be helping me these days." Days later, one night, the woodcutter went to bed, and I heard a "punch" outside the door.I was frightened, but when I quietly opened the door, I saw a large shadow under the moonlight. It was the tiger that was saved at that time. The tiger pushed a large package into its front paws without saying anything. It contained wild ginseng, honey, and a shiny pumpkin stone. The tiger bowed deeply and calmly returned to the mountain. Since that day, the woodcutter's house has become more and more prosperous. They sold wild ginseng as medicine and honey as they lived diligently. Then one winter, when the mountain road was blocked due to heavy snow, the woodcutter met a hungry group of wolves on his way back from the marketplace. The wolf roared and surrounded him.A low roar from a distance at that time. "Slurrrrrrrrrr..."In an instant, like the wind, a tiger appeared. It looked much bigger and stronger than before. The wolves dropped their tails and dispersed. The tiger approached the woodcutter and said, breathing white as snow."Your grace, I haven't forgotten," said the woodcutter, surprised and glad to bow. "Thank you very much.I'm glad you're alive." They stayed together for a long time under a big rock in the mountain that night. The tiger said quietly, "Even if it's windy and snowy, your heart will be conveyed by fragrance anywhere in the world.After that, the woodcutter stopped by the mountain every New Year and bowed to the tiger, saying, 'Thank you for the return of the benevolence.' It was also said that the village had a large footprint on the snowfield in front of the woodcutter's house on a winter night in the moonlight. People say to their children, "When people see the footprint, they say, 'Eunhye always comes back. Even beasts know how people feel." Thus, the story of 'Tiger's Boeun' spread from generation to generation, and people no longer treat wild animals carelessly. One summer night, a young woodcutter who moved in asked."Has a tiger ever really come to return the favor?" the old man replied with a smile. "Of course. If you are sincere, then both the mountain and the beast will respond." So even now, in the deep mountains, a tiger sometimes roars toward the moon. It sounds scary to anyone, but it may be a thank-you to someone.
